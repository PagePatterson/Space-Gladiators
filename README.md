# EECE2140-FinalProject

# Dependencies
## This game requires pygame to run. Please go to the command line and use pip install pygame. If you do not have pip please use your systems equivalent to install.

# Run The Game
## To run the game, open the terminal. When you are in the same directory as the sg_game.py file, use python to open the file. 

# libpng warning
## There is an annoying warning that appears every tick when the game is running. This can be ignored. Pygame just doesn't like my images, but the game will still work fine.
